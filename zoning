Hearings shall be held at the County seat unless for good cause shown they should be held elsewhere in the County.

(f)	HEARINGS:  At the time and place set for public hearing, the Zoning Adminis-trator shall hear evidence for and against each application, shall make findings as required by law and shall take such action as in his opinion is indicated by such evidence.  Applicants shall bear the same burdens of proof as provided for by State statute or County ordinance and policies.
